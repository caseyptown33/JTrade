üöÄ AutoTrade Bot on Free VPS

A bot that listens for whale swap transactions and automatically buys tokens before selling them at a higher price. It runs on a free VPS and supports Binance Smart Chain (BSC) using PancakeSwap.

üìå How It Works

‚úÖThe bot continuously monitors swap transactions on the blockchain.

‚úÖWhen a whale (large trader) swaps tokens exceeding a predefined USD amount, the bot quickly buys the token.

‚úÖThe bot waits for a price increase and sells at a target profit or cuts losses using stop-loss.

‚úÖTransactions are executed using PancakeSwap's Router contract.
